				About a year ago I decided it was time to stop “rolling my own” blog software and port things over to a modern web framework and server architecture.  After I did this something changed.

I virtually stopped blogging.

The reason for this is that it became more work to write and post entries, and the computers I could use to do so became more limited.  I could no longer write a blog post on my phone, and this was a problem for a number of reasons.

Most of the time I spend in front of a full-sized computer is not my own, and when I do have computer time to use as I choose, I spend it working on personal projects (when I have the energy to do so).  This means most of the time I find for myself is away from general-purpose computers and full-sized keyboards.

On top of this it is increasingly difficult to get photos taken with my phone onto the computers I now needed to use to create blog posts.  What took an instant before (attaching a photo to an email) now took much longer.

The result is a lot fewer posts, and the ones I managed to make were rushed or otherwise of lower quality than from years prior.

I stopped using preposter.us for a few reasons but one of them was that I made several attempts to “modernize” it which failed, and I felt like maybe this was a sign that it was time for me to get out of the blog software game.  But what is worse, running a blog on “outdated” software or a blog that is so hard to use that it never gets posted to?

(I’m going to write more about “good enough” software in the near future)

So today I decided to switch back to preposter.us.  Let’s see how that goes.
