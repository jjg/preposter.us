<p>Over the course of last week I watched the last few things I depend on my phone to remember rot away.</p>
<p>First it was my Calendar, which disappeared silently.&nbsp; I didn't know it was gone until I missed an appointment and when I went to see if I had set an alarm, the entire contents of the calendar were gone.</p>
<p>Next it was my Reminders.&nbsp; These were where I expected them in the morning and came-and-went throughout the day.&nbsp; By the following morning, they were gone.</p>
<p>Finally it was my Notes.&nbsp; Those literally vaporized before my eyes.</p>
<p>I'm waiting for the Contacts to go away next.&nbsp; I've had this happen before in the past, but this time I had the forethought to back them up.&nbsp; Of course the iPhone provides no facility for backing this up, so I had to download a third party application and grant it access to my entire Contact list.</p>
<p>Some will rationalize this or make excuses, but the fact is that there was data I recorded on my phone, and then there wasn't.&nbsp; This wasn't caused by me telling the phone to delete it, nor was it due to some bug or error.&nbsp; My data was deleted from my phone in a way that was somehow <em>by design</em>.</p>
<p>This data was on my phone, and it was also in "the cloud".&nbsp; The phone is backed-up as well.&nbsp; None of this prevented me from loosing this data, and I have no reason to believe that it won't happen again.&nbsp; One of the first principles of good software design is to respect the user's data.&nbsp; Failing to do this is tantamount to a doctor breaking their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath">Hippocratic Oath</a>.&nbsp; For a company with the resources of Apple to do this is completely unacceptable, but it has become the norm of the industry and isn't likely to change anytime soon.</p>
<p>Old computers didn't do this.&nbsp; They may have lost data due to limitations of the technology they were built from, or from bugs or other errors that were unintentional, but my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic-20">VIC-20</a> never deleted files off of a cassette tape without me explicitly telling it to, and the contact list that I started on my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton">Newton</a> was safely carried through several old computers (another Newton, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Zire">Palm Zire</a>, even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipaq">Windows devices</a>) before being destroyed by an iPhone.</p>
