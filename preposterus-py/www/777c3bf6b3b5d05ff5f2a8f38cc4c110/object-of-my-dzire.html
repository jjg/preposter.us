				<html><head><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"></head><body dir="auto">After the events of my&nbsp;<a href="https://jasongullickson.com/modern-computers-can-t-be-trusted.html">last post</a>&nbsp;I spent some time thinking about how to prevent the same thing from happening again. &nbsp;I decided to find the most modern device I’ve used that didn’t loose my data and went looking for a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zire_Handheld">Palm Zire</a>.<div><br></div><div><img src="assets/3-image0.jpeg"><br></div><div><br></div><div>I was surprised to learn that a new-in-box Zire M150 can be found on eBay for about $20 shipped, and within a week I had one back in my hands again.</div><div><br></div><div>You might ask “Why the Zire? &nbsp;There are much more powerful devices like this in the same price range.”. &nbsp;There are a couple of reasons. &nbsp;The Zire is old enough to have no network connection but new enough to have USB. &nbsp;It has a rechargeable battery but also a black &amp; white LCD so a charge goes a long way (weeks). &nbsp;It’s small and tough but not heavy. &nbsp;It also has a nostalgia factor for me because it was one of two Palm devices I’ve owned before.</div><div><br></div><div>While it arrived NIB, the hardware was not without problems. &nbsp;The primary one being that the battery would not hold a charge. &nbsp;I don’t mean it held a reduced charge, it held no charge at all. &nbsp;This became apparent when there was a brownout as I was setting up the device (while plugged in) and it reset itself to the welcome screen when the power came back on.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s not surprising that the batter is toast. &nbsp;This particular device has been in a blister pack since the early 2000’s, and it uses the lipo to maintain the contents of the devices memory. &nbsp;These batteries will become damaged if the voltage is allowed to fall below a certain level and over that many years I’m sure it dropped to zero.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Hardware Mode</b></div><div>Fortunately these devices are much easier to open than a contemporary handheld, and I just happen to have a few spare 3.7v lipos in the lab.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="assets/3-image1.jpeg"></div><div><br></div><div><img src="assets/3-image2.jpeg"></div><div><br></div><div><img src="assets/3-image3.jpeg"><br></div><div><br></div><div>The original battery is rated for 650mAh but the only thing I had on-hand were 1000mAh cells. &nbsp;This isn’t a bad thing, in fact it means that I could keep this thing running for a month or more on a single charge. &nbsp;There was one small problem however: the new cell was slightly chubbier than the original.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="assets/3-image4.jpeg"><br></div><div><br></div><div>With the replacement cell soldered-in, I plugged in the charger to see if it still worked.</div><div><br></div><div>It didn’t turn on.</div><div><br></div><div>I checked the voltage to make sure the battery had something in it (probably should have done that before soldering it in…). &nbsp;The voltage was at a safe level and climbing, indicating that the charging circuit was working as well.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="assets/3-image7.jpeg"><br></div><div><br></div><div>After letting the battery charge this way for about 30 minutes I was able to get the device to come back to life with a press of the reset button.</div><div><br></div><div>At this point I tried squeezing the case back together around the larger cell but it was not having it. &nbsp;I was going to have to modify the case or order a replacement with the same dimensions as the original.</div><div><br></div><div>Since I was already getting used to the idea of even longer battery life (not to mention feeling impatient), I decided to go the case mod route. &nbsp;After evaluating the options, I decided to take a Dremel to the case.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="assets/3-image5.jpeg"><br></div><div><br></div><div>The results are not too bad. &nbsp;They are not great, but good enough.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="assets/3-image6.jpeg"><br></div><div><br></div><div>After getting everything back together I put the whole thing back on the charger and turned my attention to the software side of things.</div><div><br></div><div><b>pilot-link</b></div><div>I’m going to use this device primarily with my System76 laptop that runs PopOS, so whatever software I use is going to have to work with Linux. &nbsp;I was able to find a lot of different software packages to work with Palm OS on Linux, but most of them have not been maintained in awhile and are no longer packaged for most distros. &nbsp;After digging around some I was able to locate the source code for a suite of CLI tools and created a form of their repository for safe keeping here:</div><div><br></div><div><a href="https://code.jasongullickson.com/jjg/pilot-link">https://code.jasongullickson.com/jjg/pilot-link</a></div><div><br></div><div>After some <a href="https://code.jasongullickson.com/jjg/pilot-link/src/branch/master/jjg_notes.md">fiddling</a>&nbsp;I was able to get the tools compiled and successfully communicating with the Zire. &nbsp;I was able to perform a full backup, import/export contacts and a few other essential things all from the comfort of a bash prompt.</div><div><br></div><div>With these tools in hand it should be a simple matter of some scripting to automate everything, I just need to decide on exactly what I want that automation to do. &nbsp;I know that I want the device to be the system-of-record for my data, and I never want the data to be removed by any external process, but I’d also like to integrate the data with other devices.</div><div><br></div><div>So now I have some design work to do. &nbsp;I didn’t expect to get this far so quickly, but with the functional hardware and basic CLI software I now have all the parts I need to build exactly what I want.</div><div><br></div></body></html>
